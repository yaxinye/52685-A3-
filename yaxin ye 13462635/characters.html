				<h3>
					Duffy
				</h3>
				<p>
					Duffy the Disney Bear is Mickey Mouse’s very own teddy bear. Born from an original Walt Disney Imagineering story, Duffy continues to be a popular Disney character with fans around the world. He has even been dubbed “the bear of happiness and luck,” and he is surely bringing lots of happiness and luck to his fans.

				<h3>
					Duffy's Friends
				</h3>
				<p>
					With the rise of Duffy's popularity, Imagineers noticed many guests purchased multiple plush of Duffy, giving the bears unique names and costumes. That inspired Imagineers to create a companion to Duffy—his best friend, ShellieMay. Based on the pair's increasing popularity, Imagineers decided to develop an entire collection of characters, each with a distinct personality and talent: artistic cat friend, Gelatoni, dancing rabbit friend, StellaLou, inventive dog friend, CookieAnn, and musical turtle friend, 'Olu Mel.

				<h3>
					StellaLou
				</h3>
				<p>
					StellaLou is a lavender rabbit whose dream is to become a Broadway dancer. She loves dancing more than anything. Whenever she hears music playing or birds singing, she feels like dancing to the sound. The path to performing on the Broadway stage is not an easy one, but she is determined and dedicated. If she makes a mistake, she keeps trying until she gets it right—she does not give up easily. All her friends cheer her on, and they are inspired and encouraged by the hard work she puts in to reach her goal.

				<h3>
					Gelatoni
				</h3>
				<p>
					Gelatoni is an artistic cat with a sunny personality. Being resourceful, he can use his tail as a paint brush or create a piece of art with whatever is available (even gelato Duffy accidentally dropped on the ground!). Besides being passionate about art, Gelatoni is able to see beauty in everything. He finds inspiration everywhere, from flowers smiling at the sun to park benches saving a space for someone special to sit. Being an artist, he is a bit unpredictable at times, but his friends find that part of him amusing.

				<h3>
					CookieAnn
				</h3>
				<p>
					CookieAnn, a yellow dog with a sensitive nose and long floppy ears, is a passionate and optimistic friend who loves to invent something novel by combining things. With a chef’s hat on her head, she is an “expert” in inventing unique recipes, bringing surprise and joy to her friends in unexpectedly delicious ways. Curious about everything, CookieAnn’s inventions go beyond culinary creations. She has fun conjuring up out-of-the-box solutions to problems by combining different ideas. Additionally, with her acute olfactory ability, she is able to smell “unsavory” happenings!

				<h3>
					ShellieMay
				</h3>
				<p>
					ShellieMay is a teddy bear Minnie Mouse made for Duffy. More adventurous than he, ShellieMay encourages Duffy to take one step further than he normally would. In that sense, ShellieMay plays an important role in expanding Duffy’s horizons. Being crafty and ingenious, she enjoys creating charming gifts for her friends—whether it’s making a scrunchy for StellaLou’s new dance routine or improvising musical instruments for 'Olu Mel. ShellieMay hopes that her small gestures will brighten their day, especially when they are in need of support and friendship.

				<h3>
					'Olu Mel 
				</h3>
				<p>
					'Olu Mel is a turtle slightly shy and reserved but is truly passionate about and talented in music. Surrounded by the beautiful nature of Hawai'i, he learned how to hear and appreciate the music played by nature—birds, trees, winds and ocean waves. He also uses his ukulele to write songs about nature, adventure, and friendship, which have the power to bring courage and smiles to his friends, and to himself! Whenever 'Olu Mel plays music, Duffy and his friends feel happy and closer to each other.

				<h3>
					linnabelle
				</h3>
			<p>
				LinaBell. She is a fox with an inquisitive mind and the intelligence that supports it. She finds joy and excitement in solving problems and mysteries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Duffy met LinaBell when he was lost in the forest following a butterfly. LinaBell suddenly but masterfully took out her magnifying glass and started examining “clues” on Duffy’s body to figure out where he had come from. Thanks to her detective-like talent, Duffy was able to be reunited with Mickey Mouse. Duffy and the rest of the friends are often in awe of her ingenious ways of solving problems.
